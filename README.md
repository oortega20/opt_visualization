# Optimizer Visualization

When taking machine learning courses, I was always fascinated with gradient descent algorithms such as SGD.
I always loved the analogy of the ball moving down the hill and how this analogy can be expressed in a mathematically rigorous way using tools such as multi-variable calculus. 
I did this project simply because I like to see this analogy visually and the only thing better than a ball rolling down a hill is many balls rolling down a hill :).

# Algorithm
TODO: write about these suckers
